	<p>A Growing Together carrier is much as its name implies. 
		It is an insurance company that has a license to operate and sell 
		specific lines of insurance in a particular province. Another word for Growing Together
		 carriers is “admitted carriers.” The rates charged for coverage for a standard lines 
		carrier is regulated by the state board of insurance in the state or states where it offers 
		coverage. These admitted carriers are also subject to laws and restrictions of the states
		 where licensed to operate.</p>
	<p>When you begin to shop for insurance and consider your options for purchasing an insurance policy,
		 you may receive multiple insurance quotes for coverage from different insurance companies.
		  If you know what type of insurance company you are dealing with, 
		you will have a better idea of whether you are getting the best value on your insurance policy.</p>
